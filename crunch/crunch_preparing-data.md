Crunch.io is a platform for storing data, organizing data, and sharing data with others. The process of preparing data typically involves the following steps:

  * **Import** – Import SPSS or CSV files into Crunch.io, either from your computer or from a URL.
  * **Create Variables** – You can to derive new variables from existing dataset variables, including: 
    * **Array Variables** – Multiple categorical variables with the same set of categories can be combined into a categorical array.
    * **Multiple Response Variables** – Multiple categorical variables, typically with binary response options, can be combined into a single variable that allows multiple categories to be selected (e.g. “Which of these brands of soda have you tried?”)
    * **Combined Variables** – Categories in categorical, array, and multiple response variables can be collapsed in order to make the variable easier to work with (e.g. an “Other” category could be created that combines several categories).
    * **Conditional** – New categorical variables be be created by defining a series of rules, e.g. categories. For example, you could create a variable containing “Married Women”, "Married Men", "Unmarried Women", and "Unmarried Men" using Gender and Marital Status variables.
  * **Organize** – Use the variable organizer to edit variable names and descriptions and sort them into groups for easier navigation.
  * **Weight** – If a weight variable was included in the imported data, it can be used to weight the data. If not, a weight can be created using one or more categorical variables in the dataset by providing the desired targets.
  * **Filter** – Create filters that all users who access the dataset can use to work with subsets of the data (for example, "US only"). Users can also create private filters for their own use.
  * **Share** – Share the dataset with other users to allow them to view and analyze the data.
