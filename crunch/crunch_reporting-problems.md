<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">If you discover a problem or have a question about something you see in the Crunch.io interface you can report it by clicking your name in the upper right and selecting Report a problem from the drop-down menu. This will open a tool called Usersnap that will allow you to enter a message about the problem you are having. It will be sent to us along with a screenshot. You can use the drawing tools in the upper left to annotate the screenshot if you feel that will help. </p>
