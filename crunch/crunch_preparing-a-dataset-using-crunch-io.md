<p>Crunch.io is a platform for organizing data and sharing it with others. In a typical scenario, a dataset will go through the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importing</strong> - SPSS or CSV files can be imported into Crunch.io via the web application, either from your computer or from a location hosted at a publicly available URL.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Variables</strong> - New variables can be created using the existing dataset variables, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Array Variables</strong> - Multiple categorical variables with the same set of categories can be combined into a categorical array.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Response Variables</strong> - Multiple categorical variables, typically with binary response options, can be combined into a single variable that allows multiple categories to be selected (e.g. “Which of these brands of soda have you tried?”)</li>
<li><strong>Combined Variables</strong> - Categories in categorical, array, and multiple response variables can be collapsed into fewer groups in order to make the variable easier to work with (e.g. an “Other” category could be created that combines several categories).</li>
<li><strong>Categorical Variables</strong> - Create categorical variables by defining a series of rules, e.g. categories such as “Married Women” created from Gender and Marital Status variables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Organization</strong> - Use the variable organizer to quickly edit variable names and descriptions and to sort them into groups for easier navigation.</li>
<li><strong>Weighting</strong> - If a weight variable was included in the imported data, it can be used to weight the data. If not, a weight can be created using one or more categorical variables in the dataset by providing the desired targets.</li>
<li><strong>Filtering</strong> - Create filters that all users who access the dataset can use to work with subsets of the data. Individual users can also create private filters for their own use.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong> - Share the dataset with other users to allow them to view and analyze the data.  </li>
</ul>
