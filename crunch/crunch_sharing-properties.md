<p>This interface can be accessed by clicking <strong>Manage Sharing</strong> in the sharing dialog (see <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=101">Sharing a Dataset</a>) or by clicking <strong>Sharing</strong> in dataset properties.</p>
<p>This interface shows a list of all users who can access this dataset. Hover over a user (other than the owner) to reveal an x that can be clicked to remove them from the list.</p>
<p>Share with additional users by clicking New User at the bottom of the list. When sharing with a user from this page, a Default Filter dropdown appears allowing one of the existing filters on the dataset to be selected (i.e. if a viewer is only interested in United States respondents, the dataset can be pre-filtered for them rather than having to instruct them to apply the filter).</p>
<p>The <strong>Viewers Can Share</strong> option determines whether viewers of the dataset can share it to other users. The owner and the current editor can always share (and can modify this property).</p>
<h3>Transferring editing rights</h3>
<p>The owner or current editor of a dataset can transfer editorship rights from this interface. All users who can become editors will have <strong>Editor</strong> next to their names - the current editor will be highlighted. Select <strong>Editor</strong> next to another user to transfer editing rights.</p>
