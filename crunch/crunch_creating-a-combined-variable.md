When you create a combined variable, you first will need to select the
variable it will be based on. Click or drag a variable from the sidebar. The
Combine Variable interface opens:

Note that the screenshot above shows the interface for combining a categorical
variable. The interfaces for combining multiple response and array variables
don't show the values but otherwise function identically.

The left side of the interface shows the source variable and the right side
shows the variable that will be created. Click the variable name or category
names on the right side of the interface to rename them. To combine categories
drag them together. Combined categories will show the categories that were
used to create them on the left and the new category on the
right:![](images/VariableCombined.png)

Right-click a combined category and select **Split Category** to split it back
into its component categories.

Hover over a category to show the valid/missing toggle on the right side. Use
this to determine whether the category will be valid or missing in the new
variable.

Once you have finished combining categories, click **Save **to create the new
variable.
