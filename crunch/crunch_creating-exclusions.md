title: "Creating Exclusions"
audience: all

An exclusion is essentially a permanent filter â€“ it allows an editor to completely hide selected rows of data from viewers.

To create an exclusion, click the dataset name and then select **Exclusions** from the tabs (you must be the active editor to do this). This will open an interface similar to [Filter Builder](crunch_filtering-data.html). You can create your exclusion in similar manner to builing a filter. Note that a dataset can only have a single exclusion, but the exclusion can include multiple variables.

When analyzing the dataset, it will behave as if the excluded rows do not exist.
