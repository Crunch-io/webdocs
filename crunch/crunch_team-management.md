Click the + to add a **New Team**. This will open another panel where you can edit the name of the team and add members. Enter the name or email addresses of the users you want to add to the team. You can choose to disable suggestions or to notify new members once you’re done. If you enter any email addresses that are not associated with a Crunch user, those users will be invited to Crunch. Once you are finished, click **Save**.
