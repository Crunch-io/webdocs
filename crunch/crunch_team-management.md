To Create a team, click the +. This will open a panel where you can edit the name of the team and add members. Enter the name or email addresses of the users you want to add to the team. If you enter any email addresses that are not associated with a Crunch user, those users will be invited to Crunch.

Set **Disable suggestions** to turn off the autocomplete feature for user names (this is recommended if cutting and pasting a list of emails).

Set **Notify new members** to email new team members.

Once you are finished, click **Save**.

Click a user’s permission to change it. Team members can be either:

**Member** – Members have no special privileges.  

**Admin** – Admins can add and remove members of the team, as well as change a user's permissions on the team.


### Giving a Team Access to a Project or Dataset

Giving a team access to a [dataset](crunch_sharing-a-dataset.html) or [project](crunch_project-management.html) is similar to sharing it with an individual. When access is granted, the team can be given view or edit privileges just like an individual, and all users on the team will be granted that level of access, though note that basic users can still only have view access even if they are granted edit access.
