Once you have created an analysis that you want to keep, you can save it by clicking **Save** in the upper right. This will slide out the save tray and add the current analysis to it.

Saved analyses will show variables used to create the analysis with an icon that indicates a graph or a table.

The information saved in an analysis includes:

  * The variables used to create the analysis.

  * Any settings in the play controller.

  * Any filters that are currently applied.

  * Whether the data is weighted.

Clicking an analysis in the save tray will cause it to be loaded into the analysis workspace.

An analysis can be deleted by hovering over it in the save tray and clicking
the x button.

Close the save tray by clicking the X above it. When the save tray is closed,
you can open it by clicking the plus symbol.

### Exporting Analyses

Click **Export to Excel** to export all saved analyses to an Excel document.
Each analysis will be put into a separate sheet in the Excel file, and the
valid/missing counts, as well as any active filters, will be included
alongside the table.
