In addition to [Deriving Variables](crunch_creating-variables.html), dataset editors can create array and multiple response variables using multiple categorical variables. When creating an array or multiple response variable, the source variables will be removed. See [Creating Array Variables](crunch_creating-an-array-variable.html) and [Creating Multiple Response Variables](crunch_creating-a-multiple-response-variable.html) for more information.
