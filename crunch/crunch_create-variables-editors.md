title: Creating Variables (Dataset Editors)
audience: all
---

A dataset editor can create the following types of variables that all users on the dataset can see and use:

A variable derived by [Combining Categories](crunch_creating-a-combined-variable.html) of an existing Categorical, Array, or Multiple Response Variable.

A [Categorical Variable](crunch_creating-a-categorical-variable.html) defined by a series of rules that each describe a category.

[Array Variables](crunch_creating-an-array-variable.html)

[Multiple Response Variables](crunch_creating-a-multiple-response-variable.html)

[Weights](crunch_weighting.html)

###Making Derived Variables Public


A variable derived by [Combining Categories](crunch_creating-a-combined-variable.html) or by [Building a Categorical Variable](crunch_creating-a-categorical-variable.html) can be created as described in those topics, but dataset editors  can choose to make the variable public to all users on the dataset.

When in one of these interfaces, dataset editors will see a public/private toggle is available in the upper right.

Set the variable to public to make it available to all users. Set it to private to make it available only to you.

You can change the privacy setting on a variable in [Variable Properties](crunch_variable-properties).
