### Working with dataset

If you've already identified the dataset you want to work with, these topics will show you how to explore and analyze the data:

[Browsing Data](crunch_browsing.html) – View toplines using Variable Cards.

[Analyzing Data](crunch_analyzing-data.html) – Create tables and graphs using one or more variables.

[Filtering Data](crunch_filtering-data.html) – View and analyze a subset of rows.

[Deriving Variables](crunch_creating-variables.html) – Create variables based on existing variables that can be used in analyses.

Use the sidebar at the left to browse to specific topics or the search bar in the upper-right to search for a topic.
