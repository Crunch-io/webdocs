You can view and edit the following properties:

**Name** – Click the dataset name to edit it.

**Description** - Click the dataset description to edit it.

**Start Date/End Date** - These properties are included to allow start and end dates to be specified as survey metadata.

**Notes** - If there are notes about the dataset that don't seem appropriate for the description, you can include them here.

**Export** - Attempts to Export the dataset to an SPSS file. Click once to begin the export – this can take some time for larger datasets. When the export is complete, the button will change to reading DatasetName.spss. Click again to download the exported dataset.
