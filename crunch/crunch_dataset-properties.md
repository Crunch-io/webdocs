The primary dataset properties page allows you to edit the following:

**Name** – Click the dataset name to edit it.

**Description** - Click the dataset description to edit it.

**Start Date/End Date** - When was the data collected? These properties are included to allow start and end dates (distinct from dataset creation and modification dates) to be included as dataset attributes.

**Minimum base size** — Suppress percentages that are based on too few total responses in their ‘base’ or margin in the direction of percentaging. For example, only show percentages for columns (with column-percentaging selected) if there are at least 50 rows in the data.

**Target population size** — The size of the population that a sample is meant to represent, and its magnitude. For example, a dataset that represents the United States population is about 320 million; if set, the display controls will allow tables and other displays to show all their values in terms of estimated population counts.

**Notes** - If you have more detailed notes about the dataset beyond its description, you can include them here.
