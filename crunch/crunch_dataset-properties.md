Open dataset properties by clicking on the dataset name in the upper left. Dataset properties can be edited by the active editor (see [Datasets with Multiple Editors](crunch_multiple-editors.html)).

You can view and edit the following properties:

**Name** – Click the dataset name to edit it.

**Description** - Click the dataset description to edit it.

**Start Date/End Date** - When was the data collected? These properties are included to allow start and end dates (distinct, obviously, from dataset creation or modification times) to be included as dataset attributes.

**Notes** - If you have more detailed notes about the dataset beyond its description, you can include them here.

**Export** - Export the dataset to an SPSS file. Click once to begin the export – this can take some time for larger datasets. When the export is complete, the button will change from "Export" to an SPSS ".sav" filename. Click again to download the exported file.
