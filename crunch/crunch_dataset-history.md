Dataset history allows you to create a saved version of the dataset and restore the dataset to previously created save points.

To open dataset history, [open dataset properties](crunch_dataset-properties.html) and then select the **History** tab. By default, the history will show a single version of the dataset which is created immediately after the dataset is created. Versions are listed from most recent to oldest.

### Saving a Dataset Version

To Save the current version of the dataset (allowing you to easily restore to this point in the future), click **Save a Version** at the bottom of the screen.

Enter a name for the version and click **Save** to create a new saved version.

### Editing and Restoring a Version

To edit or restore a saved version, hover over a version to reveal the **Edit** and **Restore** buttons.

Click **Restore** to restore the dataset to that version. Note that this cannot be undone and you will lose any changes that you made to the dataset after creating that version â€“ you will see a confirmation to prevent accidentally restoring.

Click Edit to edit the version name.
