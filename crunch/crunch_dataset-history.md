To open dataset history, click the dataset name in the upper-left and select the **History** tab. By default, the history will show a single version of the dataset which is created immediately after the dataset is created. Versions are listed from most recent to oldest.

### Saving a Dataset Version

To Save the current version of the dataset (allowing you to easily restore to this point in the future), click **Save a Version**.

In this dialog you can edit the name of the version and save or you can click **Restore** to restore the dataset to that version. Note that this cannot be undone and you will lose any changes that you made to the dataset after creating that version.
