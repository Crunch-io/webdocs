We'd love to hear any feedback or questions you have about Crunch.

### Requesting a Feature

If there are features you'd like to see added to Crunch, let us know at [support@crunch.io](mailto:support@crunch.io). We're always eager to learn how we can help you get things done better.

### Reporting a Bug

If something doesn't look right to you, we're happy to help address the issue. There are a few different scenarios. If you think there's a problem with the data in your dataset and you're not the owner of the data, try emailing the dataset's owner.

If, on the other hand, you see something amiss with the Crunch platform, please let us know. From the web application, you can report an issue by clicking the help icon in the upper right and selecting **Report a Problem**.

This will open a screenshotting tool that will allow you to take a picture of your screen and to send us a message along with it. If you're in a screen where the help icon isn't available, or if you're accessing Crunch through our R or Python libraries, you can instead email us at [support@crunch.io](mailto:support@crunch.io).

In order to ensure a quick response and resolution to your issue, please include with your report some details that will help us understand the issue. Most importantly, tell us the steps that you took, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead. If you can reproduce the issue consistently, let us know how--that will help us greatly.

If you're in R or Python, there are a few more things we'll likely ask you for before we can start investigating, so providing them up front will speed the process along. First, if you got an error, check the error message for useful information and suggestions of how to resolve the issue--we try to provide helpful error messages for common situations that may be confusing. If sending a report, R and Python users should also include code you ran that triggered the issue, and if you got an error, please provide a traceback if possible. Other environment details, including versions of installed libraries, R `sessionInfo`, etc., may also be useful. And if you're seeing an issue when working with a specific dataset or datasets, be sure to include their ids or URLs in your report.
