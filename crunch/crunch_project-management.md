title: Sharing Data with Clients
audience: all
---

Project allow advanced users to create projectsto allow data to be more easily shared with groups of clients. A project consists of one or more users and one or more datasets. All users on the project can access all datasets on the project. This allows you to both make a dataset available to a group of clients without sharing it with each of them individually, and also to add a user to a client list to give them access to many datasets at once.

###Creating a Project

To create a project, click the + in the lower left corner and select **New Project** from the menu.

Click the project name to give the project a name. Optionally enter a description. You can use a custom icon for the project by clicking the icon and selecting one using your file browser. Once you are finished, click **Save** (note that you cannot save until you have specified a name). This opens the **New Members** panel.

Enter the user names or email addresses of the users to add to the project. If you enter any email addresses that are not associated with a Crunch.io user, those users will be invited to Crunch. Set the **Notify new members** option to have an email sent to the users you add.

Once you've added some members and saved (or declined to do so by clicking **Close**), the empty project will open.

###Adding Datasets

You can drag any dataset you own from your Personal Project or from any project you can edit to any project you can edit.

Moving a dataset will remove it from its previous project or your personal project and add it to the new project. Anyone with edit permission on that project will new be able to edit, move, or delete that project.

###Project Settings

Right click a project in the sidebar and select **Settings** to open the project settings panel. This panel is identical to the one used to name the project when creating it (see above). You can edit the name, description, or icon for the project here.

###Adding and Managing Members

To add and manage members, right click the project in the sidebar. This opens a list of the existing members and their permissions.

Click a user's permission to open a drop down that allows you to change it. At this time, users can be either:

**Editor** – Full permission to edit the project and all datasets in the project.

**Viewer** – Permission to view the project and all datasets in the project.

When hovering over a user (other than yourself), an 'x' will appear on the right side of their user listing. Click this to remove them from the project. Any changes you make here will not be applied until you click **Save**.

Click **Invite Users** to open the **New Users** panel, described above.
