<p dir="ltr">The following variable card types are used to display data in browse mode:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Categorical</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="images/CategoricalCard.png" alt="" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">A categorical variable represents a question for which the respondent could choose exactly one answer. Click the Valid/Missing area at the bottom of the card to show missing reasons.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Multiple Response</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="images/MultipleResponseCard.png" alt="" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">A multiple response variable represents a question for which the respondent could choose any number of responses, i.e. “choose all that apply.” As with categorical variables you can click the Valid/Missing area to show missing reasons.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Numeric</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="images/Numeric.png" alt="" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">A numeric variable represents a question to which the respondent gave a numeric answer. The variable card displays a histogram of the responses as well as summary statistics.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Date/Time</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="images/DateTime.png" alt="" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">A date/time variable represents a timestamp, for example the date of a survey. The variable card displays a histogram of the dates in the variable.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Categorical Array</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="images/Array.png" alt="" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">A categorical array represents a series of questions with the same response options. The responses are shown in the columns while the individual questions are shown in the rows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Valid/missing shows how many valid responses there are for any question in the array as well as for all questions in the array. For example, if a respondent did not have a mobile device in the array above, they would be counted under Valid (any), but not Valid (all).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Click Valid or Missing  to see the number of missing values for each row.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Array Variables in the Sidebar</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Hover over a categorical array variable in the sidebar to display a plus symbol next to the name.</p>
