title: "Sharing a Dataset"
audience: all

The crunch sharing interface allows you to share a dataset you have access to with one or more other users. If you are an advanced user managing a set of datasets shared with a set of client users, it is recommended you create a project as described in [Sharing Data With Clients](crunch_project-management.html) rather than using the sharing method described here.

Share a dataset by clicking the dataset name and selecting Share from the dropdown menu.

The share panel slides out.

Enter comma-separated email addresses, user names, or [teams](crunch_team-management.html) to grant other users access to the dataset. If they haven’t worked with data in Crunch before, they will be invited automatically. 

If you have permission to edit the dataset, the **Manage dataset users** link will take you to [Permissions](crunch_sharing-properties.html), where you can change access and editorship of other users.

If the dataset belongs to a project that you have permission to edit, **Manage project members** will slide out the [project permissions](crunch_project-management.html) panel.
