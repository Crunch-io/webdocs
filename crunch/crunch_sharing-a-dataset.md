<p>Share a dataset by clicking <strong>Share</strong> in the upper-right of the interface. Enter one or more comma-separated email addresses in the share dialog to share the dataset with other users (if there is no account associated with an email address, a new basic account will be created).</p>
<p>If you have permission to edit the dataset, a <strong>Manage Sharing</strong> link will take you to <a href="9-editors-help/21-sharing-properties.html">Sharing Properties</a>, where you can unshare the dataset and grant editorship rights to other users.</p>
