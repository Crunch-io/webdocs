Share a dataset by clicking **Share** in the upper-right of the interface. Enter one or more comma-separated email addresses in the share dialog to share the dataset with other users. If they haven’t worked with data in Crunch before, they will be invited automatically.

If you have permission to edit the dataset, a **Manage Sharing** link will take you to [Sharing Properties](crunch_sharing-properties.html), where you can change access and editorship of other users.
