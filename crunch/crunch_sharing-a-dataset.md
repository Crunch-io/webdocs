Share a dataset by clicking **Share** in the upper-right of the interface.
Enter one or more comma-separated email addresses in the share dialog to share
the dataset with other users (if there is no account associated with an email
address, a new basic account will be created).

If you have permission to edit the dataset, a **Manage Sharing** link will
take you to [Sharing Properties](9-editors-help/21-sharing-properties.html),
where you can unshare the dataset and grant editorship rights to other users.
