title: "Datasets with Multiple Editors"
audience: all
---

When a dataset has multiple editors, only one editor can actively edit the dataset at a time. This prevents data and metadata from getting out of sync. You must be the active editor to:

* Edit dataset properties.
* Edit variable properties.
* Organize variables.
* Create public filters.
* Create public variables.

Dataset editors will see a lock icon near the upper-right corner.

If unlocked, you are the active editor on the dataset. Click the lock to stop editing.

If locked, you are not the active editor. Click the lock to become the active editor. If another user is currently the active editor, you will see a warning that you are taking editing rights from them â€“ if they are in the middle of an edit (e.g. they currently have variable or dataset properties open), they will lose their incompleted changes.
