"summary": "",
"body": "For a deeper look at data than what is available in card view, you can create, save, and exportunivariate and multivariate tables and graphs in **Expanded View**.![](images/ViewToggleAnalyze.png)To enter this view:* click the icon in the view toggle at the top of the interface to expand the variable card on the far left into a univariate table,* double-click on a variable card in card view to expand the selected variable card as a univariate table,* or drag a variable from the left sidebar list onto a card in card view to create a crosstab of the two selected variables.When you enter this view, you will see a table of the selected analysis.### Variables in an analysis![](images/Table.png)An analysis contains one or more variables. These variables have a role in the analysis - how the roles are named and viewed depends on how many variables there are and what analysis view you are looking at (see The Display Controller, below, for more information about changing the analysis view). Variables can be in the following roles:* **Row Variable** – Defines the rows of a table or graph. In the case of a univariate analysis, the single variable is considered the row variable. In the example above, Unaided Awareness (Coffee Roasters) is the row variable.* **Column/Group/Slice Variable** - In a table, the Column variable defines the table columns (Gender in the example above). When viewing the analysis as a graph, this variable can be used as the Group variable (when viewing the analysis as a single graph) or the Slice variable (when viewing the graph as a sliced graph of small multiples). See Grouped and Sliced Graphs, below, for an example of a sliced versus grouped graph.* **Tab Variable** - Defines clickable tabs to show an analysis segmented across a third variable. In the example above Education is the tab variable, and we are currently looking at the HS or Less tab. * **Mean Variable** - You can use the mean of a variable as the values (rather than percentages or counts). For example, if we were to use Age as the mean in the table above, the upper-left cell would contain the mean age of Male, Blue Bottle Coffee Aware respondents.### Adding and Replacing the Variables in the AnalysisDrag and drop a variable (from either the sidebar or the seach panel) on to an analysis to show a collection of dropzones that allow you to add or replace variables used in the current analysis. ![](images/DropZones.png)What dropzones are available varies depending on the type of variables, the number of variables, and the type of analysis.In addition to dropzones for the analysis roles described above, there will always be a **Variable as New Table/Graph** dropzone. Dropping a variable here will remove all variables currently in the analysis and create a univariate analysis with the selected variable.#### Categorical array variablesA categorical array – a variable made up of a group of items that share a common set of categories — defines two dimensions. When you make a new table or graph, the default view has the items as rows and the categories as a common set of columns, with percentages calculated by row. If you already have a column or group variable in an analysis, the categories of the array become the rows, with the same columns in place, and tabs appear to select an item of the array.#### Components of array and multiple response variablesCategorical array and multiple response variables are made up of component that describe one column of an array or one category of a multiple response variable. If you want to use one of the component variables in an analysis click the + in the sidebar next to the variable name. This will display component variables that can be dragged to the analysis individually.![](images/SidebarArrayExpand.png)### Removing a variables from an analysisHover over a variable in an analysis to reveal an 'x' next to the variable name. Click the 'x' to remove the variable. There are some graph types where this does not work correctly - if you are having trouble change to table view to remove the variable.### Graph typesTables have a consistent look regardless of variable types, but Crunch supports several different sorts of graphs depending on what sort of variables are being used.#### Groups and SlicesWhen creating graphs you will see **Slice** and **Group** dropzones rather than just the **Column** option used for tables. What sort of graph you get will differ depending on where you drop the variable.A grouped graph shows the analysis in a single graph – the analysis is broken down by the group variable within the categories of the row variable.![](images/GroupedAnalysis.png)A sliced graph shows a series of small univariate graphs – one for each category in the second variable.![](images/SlicedAnalysis.png)Graphs cannot contain both a group and slice variable at this time – if you add a group variable it will replace the slice variable and vice versa.#### Time PlotsIf a date/time variable is used as the column variable, the graph will be displayed as a time plot, showing the row variable over time.![](images/TimePlotAnalysis.png)#### Numeric VariablesWhen viewed as a graph, numeric variables will display a histogram. If sliced by a second variable, a histogram will be shown for each category in the second variable.![](images/HistogramsAnalysis.png)### Using the Display ControllerThe Display Controller at the bottom of the analyze interface is used tochange some settings.![](images/DisplayController2.png)Which controls are displayed depends on the analysis being viewed. Thefollowing controls are available:![](images/DisplayTableGraph.png)|Table/Graph - Use this control to toggle between showing a table and a graph.The graph type will vary by the types of the variables in the analysis.  ---|---  ![](images/DisplayControllerDirection.png)|Count/Percentage, Percent Direction, and Significance testing - Use thiscontrol to toggle between counts and percentages. If viewing percentages in abivariate table or graph, click the arrow control to toggle betweenpercentages summing by column (down), by row (right), or across the wholetable. When viewing a table, click the * to enable significance testing - thiswill add shading to the graph indicating if a value is significantly above orbelow the mean value for that row or column (depending on how the percentagesare being summed).  ![](images/Display Digits.png)|Decimal Places - If viewing an analysis that uses decimal points either forpercentages or for numeric means, use this control to determine how manydigits are shown after the decimal point.  ![](images/DisplayMissing.png)|Show Empty - If unselected any rows or columns in a table or graph that areentirely empty will be hidden. If selected empty rows and columns will bedisplayed. Note that adding filters may cause a row or column to become empty.  ![](images/DisplayPivot.png)|Pivot - Click this control to swap the row variable and the column/group/slicevariable."

"body": "New variables can be derived from existing variables. To start creating a newvariable, click +New Variable at the bottom of the sidebar.![](images/NewVariableButton.png)#### Public and Private Variables![](images/PublicPrivate.png)Categorical variables and Combined variables can be created on a dataset byany user. When a dataset viewer creates one of these variables, they arealways private - only the use who created it can see and use the variable.When a dataset editor creates a combined variable or a categorical variable,the Public/Private toggle appears in the upper-right corner. This sliderdetermines if the new variable is private (available only to the user thatcreated it) or public (available to everyone who can access the dataset).Array, Multiple Response, and Weight variables are always created as public toall viewers of the dataset.### Creating a Combined VariableSee [Creating a CombinedVariable](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12&catid=2&Itemid=101).### Creating a Categorical VariableSee [Creating a CategoricalVariable](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13&catid=2&Itemid=101).### Creating a Categorical Array Variable![](images/NewArrayVariable.png)To create an array variable, select or drag the variables that will form the\"subvariables\", or rows of the array. The columns of the array will be formedby the union of the categories of all selected variables. Typically, an arraywill be comprised of variables that share a set of categories.Note that when creating a categorical array variable, the variables you groupto form the array will no longer appear separately in the web application.This is in contrast with the combined-categories variable, which does notoverwrite the uncombined source variable. You will, however, be able to accessthe subvariables within a categorical array separately for analysis.### Creating a Multiple Response Variable ![](images/NewMRVariable.png)To create a multiple response variable:  1. Select or drag the variables that will be used to create the new variable. Each of these variables will be one category in the new multiple response variable.  2. As variables are added to the multiple response variable interface, the categories of these variables will appear in a list. Select all categories that indicate a positive or \"selected\" response. As with creating a categorical array, when you bind categorical variables intoa multiple response variable, they are no longer available separately in theweb application.### Creating a Weight![](images/NewWeight.png)Weighting a dataset allows you to adjust the data to a specific required ratioof one or more variables - usually demographic variables. For example, if 1000people were surveyed - 600 men and 400 women, but the study in question wasfor an area that had a 50/50 split of men and women, you could weight theresponses of the women a little more heavily to adjust for the uneven split inyour sample size.A weight variable is a numeric variable where each row contains a multiplierthat indicates how that row should be given more or less importance. When aweight is created in Crunch.io, this numeric weight variable is created byspecifying the target values for one or more categorical values (in theexample above, 50% Male and 50% Female). A weight variable can be constructedfrom multiple categorical variables (for example to adjust the data for targetgenders, ages, and incomes).To create a weight:  1. Select one or more existing categorical variables that will be used to create the weight.  2. For each selected variable, their categories and the distribution of responses in those categories will be shown in the **SAMPLE** row. Enter the normalized values you would like to use in the **TOTAL** row. These values must sum to 100.Once a weight is created it will be applied to the dataset. Multiple weightscan be created - which one is applied can be changed using the weight menu inthe upper right."

"body": "In card view, each variable appears on a **Variable card**. The variable card displays a top-line summary of the data contained in that variable.Hover your mouse cursor over a variable to reveal the **Properties** link below the card - click this link to reveal Variable Properties for that variable. Note that if you cannot edit the dataset, these properties will be read-only.The following varaible types are currently supported by Crunch.### Categorical![](images/VariableCardCategorical.png)A categorical variable represents a question for which the respondent couldchoose exactly one answer. Click **Valid/Missing** at the bottom of thecard to show missing values and reasons.### Multiple Response![](images/VariableCardMR.png)A multiple response variable represents a question for which the respondentcould choose any number of responses, i.e. “choose all that apply.” As withcategorical variables you can click the Valid/Missing area to show missingvalues and reasons.### Numeric![](images/VariableCardNumeric.png)A numeric variable represents a question to which the respondent gave anumeric answer. The variable card displays a histogram of the responses aswell as summary statistics.### Date/Time![](images/VariableCardDate.png)A date/time variable represents a timestamp, for example the date of a survey.The variable card displays a histogram of the dates in the variable.### Categorical Array![](images/VariableCardArray.png)A categorical array represents a series of questions with the same responseoptions. The responses are shown in the columns while the individual questionsare shown in the rows.Valid/missing shows how many valid responses there are for any question in thearray as well as for all questions in the array. For example, if a respondentdid not have a mobile device in the array above, they would be counted underValid (any), but not Valid (all).Click Valid or Missing  to see the number of missing values for each row.### Array and Multiple Response Variables in the SidebarHover over an array or multiple response variable variable in the sidebar to display a plussymbol next to the name.![](images/SidebarArrayCollapse.png)Click the plus to show the variables that make up the array.![](images/SidebarArrayExpand.png)"

"body": "When editing a dataset, you can access properties of individual variables byclicking **Edit** underneath the variable card.![](images/edit-variable-properties-resized.png)You can edit the name and description of all variables, as well as hide ordelete them. (these can also be done in the variable organizer).![](images/variable-properties-page.png)Example properties panelAdditional properties depend on the variable type:### Categorical Variable Properties**Numeric Values** \\- Show or hide the numeric value associated with each category. These values can be used to treat the variable as numeric (and compute its mean) in an analysis.**Counts/Percentages** \\- Show counts or percentages on the variable card.**Decimal Places** \\- If showing percentages, how many decimal places to display on the variable card.**Include/Exclude Missing** \\- If set to **Include**, missing categories will be shown on the variable card and missing rows will be used when calculating percentages.### Numeric Variable Properties**Use as Weight** \\- Set to yes to use this numeric variable as a weight for the dataset. Weight variables can also be created using existing categorical variables using the Weight Builder.**Add Missing Value/Range** \\- Designate a value or range of values on this numeric value that should be marked as missing.### Text Variable Properties**Counts/Percentages** \\- Show counts or percentages on the variable card.**Decimal Places** \\- If showing percentages, how many decimal places to display on the variable card.**Add missing** \\- Designate a text string to be treated as missing.### Multiple Response Variable Properties**Counts/Percentages** \\- Show counts or percentages on the variable card.**Decimal Places** \\- If showing percentages, how many decimal places to display on the variable card.**“None of the Above”** \\- If set to **Yes**, the variable will include a None of the Above category used for rows in which none of the constituent variables is true.  **Include/Exclude Missing** \\- If set to **Include**, missing categories will be shown on the variable card and missing rows will be used when calculating percentages.**Split** – Turn each row of the variable into a separate categorical variable.### Array Variable Properties**Counts/Percentages** \\- Show counts or percentages on the variable card.**Decimal Places** \\- If showing percentages, how many decimal places to display on the variable card.**Include/Exclude Missing** \\- If set to Include, missing categories will be shown on the variable card and missing rows will be used when calculating percentages.**Rearrange** – Change the names, values, missingness, and order of items and categories.**Split** – Turn each “row” item of the array into a separate categorical variableWhen finished, you can save your changes, and if you cancel, you’ll be askedto confirm that you want to discard changes.![Discard changes confirmation](images/variable-properties-save.png)Discardchanges confirmation"
