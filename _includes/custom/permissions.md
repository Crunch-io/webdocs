### User Permissions
View and change permissions on the dataset by clicking **Permissions** in dataset properties.

This interface shows all users who have direct access to this dataset and their level of access. Note that users may also be granted permission by being in the project that contains the dataset. If the dataset belongs to a project, the project name will be listed on the right. To see a complete list of all users who can access the dataset, see Users.

You can change the level of permission a user has using the dropdown under **Permissions**. **Viewers** can view a dataset and make personal filters, variables, and multitables. **Editors** can make shared filters, variables, and multitables and make changes to the dataset data and metadata.

You can remove a user from the list by hovering over them and clicking the **x** on the left side.

In the case of a dataset with many users this list can be filtered using the **Filter** input.
