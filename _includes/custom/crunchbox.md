A CrunchBox are used to embed embed Crunch data in any website in an interactive widget.

Create a CrunchBox by opening [Dataset Properties](crunch_dataset-properties.html) and then clicking **CrunchBox**.

### Selecting variables

The dataset’s variables are listed on the left side of the CrunchBox builder. Select the variables and groups you would like to be included in the CrunchBox.

### Selecting Filters

Choose which filters will be available to CrunchBox users on the right side. By default, any filters that were applied to the dataset will still be applied, and you can [add and remove filters](crunch_filtering-data.html) by clicking the plus to add or by clicking the **x** next to a filter to remove it. 

### Building the CrunchBox

Once you have selected variables and filters you want to include, click **Build**. You can create multiple CrunchBoxes from the same dataset. Note that when a CrunchBox is built, it will take a snapshot of the current data – if further updates are made to the dataset, you should build a new CrunchBox to replace the existing one.

Once the CrunchBox is built, click the **Share** icon. To get the embed code, click on the **Embed** icon.
