CrunchBox is a special purpose widget that allows to embed data in any website.

Create a CrunchBox by opening [Dataset Properties](crunch_dataset-properties.html) and then clicking **CrunchBox**.

### Selecting variables

The dataset’s variables are listed on the left side. You can choose to build a CrunchBox only with a subset of variables by deselecting any variables or groups that you don’t want to include.

### Filtering variables

You can choose which filters to include in your CrunchBox on the right side. By default, any filters that were applied to the dataset will still be applied, and you can [add and remove filters](crunch_filtering-data.html) in the same manner as you would elsewhere.

### Building a CrunchBox

Once you have determined what variables and filters you want to include, click **Build** to build a CrunchBox. You can create multiple crunchboxes with the same dataset.

Once your CrunchBox is built, click the **Share** icon and you will have many options to share. To get the embed code click on the **Embed** icon and now you can insert in any website.
