The variable organizer allows dataset editors to sort variables into groups and determine the order in which they will appear in the sidebar. It can also be used to quickly edit variable names, descriptions, and aliases.

If the dataset you wish to organize is already shared with other users, you should consider [creating a draft](crunch_draft-and-publish.html) before organizing it (or making other large changes). This will allow you to assure that the dataset organization appears as you expect before pushing the reorganized dataset to your clients.

Open the variable organizer by [opening dataset properties](crunch_dataset-properties.html) and then selecting the **Edit Variables** tab.

Variables are listed in their current order, along with their descriptions and aliases.

On the right side of the interface, you'll see a sidebar with options to create a **New Folder**, **Delete** and **Open hidden**.

### Changing variable order

The order of variables in the list can be changed by dragging and dropping them. Select multiple variables at once using shift-click and command-click (Mac)/control-click (PC). Once a group of variables has been selected they can be dragged as a group.

### Creating and using folders

Create a folder by clicking **New Folder** in the sidebar. This opens the **New folder name** dialog, where you can give the folder a name.

The new folder will appear at the top of the variable list. You can drag and drop variables or folders into a folder to move them. Click the folder icon to open a folder and view and organize its contents.

When a folder is open, the path to that folder is shown at the top of the interface.

Drag variables or folders to a location on the path to move them up in the hierarchy. Click on a location on the path to navigate to it directly.

### Editing variable and folder names, descriptions, and aliases

You can double click any variable or folder name, description, or alias to edit it. You can use **Tab** to move to the next field or **Enter** to move to the next row (i.e. if you are editing a description you'll move to the next description).

You can arrange variables or put them into folders. Variables can be organized into folders by dragging and dropping on top of the desired folder.

### Hiding, unhiding, and deleting variables

Hidden variables or folders do not appear in the variables list. Deleted variables or folders are permanently removed from the dataset; any filters, analyses, or other variables derived from a deleted variable may be removed as a result.

When a variabl(s) and/or folder(s) are selected, actions that can be performed on them. Click **Move to hidden** to hide a variable or folder (or a group of selected variables and/or folders). Once hidden, the variable or folder will disappear. You can view hidden variables in the Organize interface by toggling on **Open hidden** in the sidebar, and then unhide them by selecting them and selecting **Unhide**.

Permanently delete a variable or folder by clicking **Delete**.
