Export data by opening [Dataset Properties](crunch_dataset-properties.html) and then clicking **Export**.

The dataset's variable are listed on the left side. By default all variables are selected &8211; you can choose to export only a subset of variables by deselecting any variables or groups that you don't want to export.

You can use the filter bar on the right side to export a filtered subset of rows. By default, any filters that were applied to the dataset will still be applied, and you can [add and remove filters](crunch_filtering-data.html) in the same manner as you would elsewhere.

Once you have determined what rows and columns to export, select a format (SPSS or CSV) from the **Format** selector and click the **Export** button. The button will read **Exporting...** while the export is prepared.

Once the export is complete, the **Export** button will be replaced by **Download** and **Cancel**.
