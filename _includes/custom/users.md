Open Dataset Users by selecting the Users tab in dataset properties or by clicking **Manage dataset users** from the [share](crunch_sharing-a-dataset.html) panel.

**Users** shows all users who can see the dataset, how they were granted access, and when they last accessed it.

In the case of a dataset with many users this list can be filtered using the **Filter** input.

If a user was granted permissions in multiple ways (e.g. they are a project member as well as having the dataset shared with them directly), both permissions will be shown, separated with a comma.

Click on a user's permission to open the [Permissions](crunch_permissions-and-defaults.html) page with that user filtered.

If a user has access via a project and you have permission to edit the project, click the project name to [modify project permissions](crunch_project-management.html).

Click the **+** to [share the dataset](crunch_sharing-a-dataset.html) with additional users.
