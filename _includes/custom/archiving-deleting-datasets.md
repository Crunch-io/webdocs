Datasets can be archived or deleted. Select **Archive/Delete** from [dataset properties](crunch_dataset-properties.html). When a dataset is archived it can be accessed and restored by the owner from the Archive label in the dataset list. If a dataset is deleted, it is removed permanently and cannot be recovered.
