An exclusion is essentially a permanent filter â€“ it allows an editor to remove some rows from consideration entirely in any analyses or queries involving the dataset.

To create an exclusion, [open dataset properties](crunch_dataset-properties.html) and then select **Exclusions** (you must be the active editor to do this). This will open an interface similar to [Filter Builder](crunch_filtering-data.html). You can create your exclusion in similar manner to builing a filter. Note that a dataset can only have a single exclusion, but the exclusion can include multiple variables.

When analyzing the dataset, it will behave as if the excluded rows do not exist.
